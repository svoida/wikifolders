    <p>The Mac OS X Finder gives you lots of ways to organize and view your files&mdash;by icon, by list, and using the new Cover Flow technology in Leopard&mdash;but very few options if you want to describe what the files in a folder mean to you and how they relate to one another.</p>
    <p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be useful if Finder included a view that worked like a web page, allowing you to add text and pictures to help you remember what a group of files is about? What if you could create groupings for files that you created at different stages of a project and leave yourself notes about each cluster, such as the date you submitted the files for review and the goals you were trying to accomplish in each stage? WikiFolders gives you this kind of power and flexibility, letting you see your files and the annotations describing those files side-by-side, right in the Finder.</p>
    <h1>Easy Editing&hellip;Just Like a Wiki</h1>
    <p>WikiFolders allows you to add rich-text annotations to any of your folders with the same, familiar markup used by web-based wikis. You can group your files together, create headings, format your text, and include inline images. You can even use standard HTML formatting to create more exotic formatting like boxes and multi-column layouts.</p>
    <p>The WikiFolders markup editor includes a quick-reference formatting drawer, so help is always just a click away. And if you&rsquo;re not sure how you want your folder to look, just try it out&hellip;WikiFolders shows you the result of your changes right away, and it&rsquo;s easy to remove the formatting altogether if you don&rsquo;t like how it turns out.</p>
    <h1>Automatically Keep Your Annotations Up-to-Date</h1>
    <p>While the WikiFolders application is running, your folder&rsquo;s annotations are automatically updated whenever the folder&rsquo;s content changes. When you add a file, its filename is added to the folder&rsquo;s markup file and it is automatically placed at the bottom of the folder. When you remove a file, the markup is updated with a placeholder showing where that file used to be listed. When you make edits to the folder&rsquo;s display options or markup, the new annotation view is re-generated immediately.</p>
      <h1>Annotations Anyone Can See</h1>
      <p>The WikiFolders application changes icon view options for each of the folders you annotate, which means that your annotations are visible to anyone who uses the Finder to browse your folders, even when they are shared across a network. Your friends and colleagues don&rsquo;t even need the WikiFolders application installed to see the notes and formatting you&rsquo;ve applied to your folders, although they do need to grab a copy of WikiFolders (and have write access to the folder) if they want to contribute to the folder annotations.</p>
      <a name="research" /><h1>You Can Participate in the Research</h1>
      <p>WikiFolders is part of an ongoing academic research project on developing information organization and sharing tools. This research is being carried out in the <a href="http://grouplab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca">GroupLab</a> in the <a href="http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca">University of Calgary</a> and is led by Drs. <a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~svoida/">Stephen Voida</a> and <a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~saul/">Saul Greenberg</a>. We are looking for volunteers to use WikiFolders as part of their day-to-day computer work for approximately one month. Your participation would be strictly anonymous, however you will have the option to provide contact information if you are willing to participate in a follow-up interview. The follow-up interview would take no more than one hour of your time.</p>
      <p>If you wish to participate, you can download the research version of the software below. The only difference between the two versions of the software is that the research version will collect information about how you use the WikiFolders application and periodically upload that information to our servers. Please read the description of informed consent before you proceed. If you have any questions about the research project, please contact Stephen Voida at (403) 210-9507 or <a href="mailto:svoida@ucalgary.ca?subject=WikiFolders research project">svoida@ucalgary.ca</a> or Saul Greenberg at (403) 220-6087 or <a href="mailto:saul.greenberg@ucalgary.ca?subject=WikiFolders research project">saul.greenberg@ucalgary.ca</a>.</p>
